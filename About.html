<div class="about">
<p>Two years before CEUâ€™s centennial celebration, on March 22, 2005, the community witnessed the birth of CEU Makati, Gil Puyat Campus. The academic offerings included degree programs that responded to the global market particularly Hotel and Restaurant Management, Tourism Management, Information Technology, Computer Science, Business Administration, Mass Communication major in Broadcasting, Master of Business Administration and first-class health science programs for which CEU has always been known such as Doctor of Dental Medicine, Medical Technology, Nursing, Pharmacy, Doctor of Pharmacy, and Psychology.

Dr. Maria Cristina D. Padolina became the seventh CEU President in August 2006. As CEU Centennial President, she brought to her post an impressive international educational background with sterling and extensive leadership and management experience in academe and government, a wisdom she gathered over the years after having been the Open University (UPOU) Chancellor of the University of the Philippines and a Commissioner of the Commission on Higher Education of the Republic of the Philippines.

She spearheaded the opening of the second campus of Centro Escolar University Makati-Legazpi in 2007, the School of Law and Jurisprudence in 2009 and the establishment of a program on Professional and Continuing Education (PACE) to address the clamor and the need for lifelong learning in the light of continuing scientific and technological innovations and change.</p>
